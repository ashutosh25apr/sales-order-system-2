I have modified the GitHub Actions workflow to fix the npm dependency caching issue.

To apply the fix, you need to:

1.  Commit the changes I've made to your repository.
2.  Push the changes to the `main` branch.

This will trigger the workflow with the corrected caching configuration.

If you want me to commit the changes for you, please let me know.
