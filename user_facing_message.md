I have modified the `build-all.sh` script to add a 30-second delay before building the `order-service`. This should give the Docker-in-Docker service enough time to start and be ready for the tests.

To apply the fix, you need to:

1.  Commit the changes I've made to your repository.
2.  Push the changes to the `main` branch.

This will trigger the workflow with the corrected script.

If you want me to commit and push the changes for you, please let me know.
