I have created a GitHub Actions workflow that will build and test the application in a clean and consistent environment. This will solve the platform-specific issues you were facing.

To use it, you need to:

1.  Commit the changes I've made to your repository.
2.  Push the changes to the `main` branch.

This will trigger the workflow, and you will be able to see the build progress in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

If you want me to commit the changes for you, please let me know.
