Please let me know how you'd like to proceed:

1.  **Wait for `customer-service` build results:** We should confirm that the `customer-service` build is now successful after the `groovy-all` fix before proceeding.
2.  **Make similar `<type>pom</type>` removal changes for `product-service` and `user-service` now:** I can proactively apply this fix to the other Maven-based services, then trigger their builds.
3.  **Other tasks?**
