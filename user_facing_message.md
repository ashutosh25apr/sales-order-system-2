I have modified the GitHub Actions workflow to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variables for Java 8 and Java 21. This should resolve the Java version mismatch during the `order-service` build.

To apply the fix, you need to:

1.  Commit the changes I've made to your repository.
2.  Push the changes to the `main` branch.

This will trigger the workflow with the corrected environment.

If you want me to commit and push the changes for you, please let me know.
