I understand the build is still failing. To effectively troubleshoot, I need the **full logs** from the latest GitHub Actions run for the `Order Service Build` workflow.

Please navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository, find the latest run for the `Order Service Build` workflow, and paste the *full output* here.

Without the specific error messages from the logs, I cannot determine the exact cause of the current failure. Once I have the logs, I will analyze them and propose the next steps.
