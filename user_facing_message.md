I have modified the GitHub Actions workflow to include a Docker-in-Docker service. This will provide a Docker environment for the tests in the `order-service` and should fix the build failure.

To apply the fix, you need to:

1.  Commit the changes I've made to your repository.
2.  Push the changes to the `main` branch.

This will trigger the workflow with the corrected environment.

If you want me to commit and push the changes for you, please let me know.
