The `product-service` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/product-service-build.yml`) is correctly configured for Java 8.

The `git log` confirms that this workflow file was added to the repository with commit `f6eadd5`. This means a build for `product-service` should have already been triggered on GitHub Actions.

**Please provide the full logs from the latest GitHub Actions run for the `Product Service Build` workflow.** This will confirm if the `product-service` builds successfully using GitHub Actions in its current Java 8 configuration.
